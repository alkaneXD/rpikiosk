Library Installation (Wheezy)
=============================

This installs PIL however many pages are recommending that you use pillow instead.  This needs checking out.

Launch a terminal and execute the following commands -

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libtiff4-dev libjpeg8-dev zlib1g-dev libfreetype6-dev liblcms2-dev libwebp-dev tcl8.5-dev tk8.5-dev python-tk
sudo apt-get install python-imaging
sudo apt-get install python-bitarray
git clone https://github.com/lincolnloop/python-qrcode
cd python-qrcode
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
rm -rf python-qrcode

Notes
=====

1) User is invited to input some data
2) Data is converted to QR code
3) QR code is converted to image
4) Image is scaled-up to give best width whilst maintaining best possible aspect ratio
